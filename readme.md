this web page is to meet Valinteca test task, which required building the page in the live website url using html, css and js only

live url: https://ali-khaled-13.github.io/valinteca-shop/

to be honest it was a challenge going from React back to plain JS. also no deisng files were given so sorry about the imperfect UI.

anyways, if you are interested in viewing a website with the same premise and technology, but much more advanced. here is a [repository](https://github.com/ALI-KHALED-13/The-Arabian-Kitchen) of a project I built 2 years ago using the same basic html, css and js
